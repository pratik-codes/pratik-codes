<h3>Bonjour ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

<b>Welcome to my digital lair. Iâ€™m a fullstack developer with 4+ years of experience hacking the web, worked into the realms of edtech, AI, finance, and Web3. I specialize in Go, Rust, Next/React, Node, AWS, and Solidity, but my curiosity is infiniteâ€”always exploring new tools and tech.

Here at my command center, I build with precision, from distributed systems to decentralized architectures. I'm passionate about performance, developer productivity, and the power of the terminalâ€”whether itâ€™s in Neovim, NixOS, or anywhere a terminal window shines.<b/>
